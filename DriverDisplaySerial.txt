The driver display expects serial data in the following form:

<field><field-val separator><value><record separator>...

<field> := 	velo
		|	curr
		|	avlt
		|	atmp
		|	effy
		|	text

<field-val separator> := ASCII 0x1F (^_)
		
<value> := (anything)

<record separator> := ASCII 0x1E (^^, Ctrl + ^)

The fields correspond as follows:
velo = velocity
curr = current
avlt = average voltage
atmp = average temperature
effy = efficiency
text = generic message

The field-value data can be received in any order with any relative frequency (i.e., velocity data can be received twice as often, or half as often, or 1.55 times as often, etc. as current data).
